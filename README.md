DISCLAIMER:			THIS IS NOT AN ORIGINAL PROJECT!!!
ORIGINAL AUTHORS: 		Truc Le and Ye Duan
MODIFIED AT:			Skoltech, FSE (2021)

THIS PROJECT WAS NOT DEVELOPED FROM SCRATCH. It is a modification from a Software
Engineering point of view and this particular modification's design is in such a way
as to make thingseasier by  automating most of the processes and intsallations of
dependencies required for this project to run. 


				PLEASE NOTE: 
			      ***************

This project is just but an improvement of the original one and and I didn't have
enough time to work on it (spoiler alert!! I also don't have much experience with
Tensoflow). Having said that, it is possible  that there are some things that I
missed and yet they are crucial to the correct functionality of the project. In such
a case, I am providing you with a fully functional shell, that can be used for 
further modifications and/or installations.

Further development of this project is NOT copyright protected but in case you have
questions, feel free to 
contact:

	*******************************************************************

Due to lack of time, I wasn't able to test and verify the functionality of each and
every part of this project modification. I however hope that the steps left will be
much easier and smoother. 

Before you begin, please run the installations.sh executable in the root folder or
copy-paste the following commands:

1. to verify that the installations.sh executable is there run:
	ls
	
2. It's time to make some installations. please note that this may take time and 
   an internet connection is needed
	./installations.sh

3. now you can navigate to the folder with the project. Please read each README
   file in every folder:
	cd PointGrid/
	
The folder names are quite self explanatory and I assume that you know the basics
of folder navigation.
