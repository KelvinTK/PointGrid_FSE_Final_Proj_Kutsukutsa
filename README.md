MODIFIED AT:			Skoltech, FSE (2021)

THIS PROJECT WAS NOT DEVELOPED FROM SCRATCH. It is a modification from a Software
Engineering point of view and this particular modification's design is in such a way
as to make thingseasier by  automating most of the processes and intsallations of
dependencies required for this project to run. 


				PLEASE NOTE: 
			      ***************

This project is just but an improvement of the original one and and I didn't have
enough time to work on it (spoiler alert!! I also don't have much experience with
Tensoflow). Having said that, it is possible  that there are some things that I
missed and yet they are crucial to the correct functionality of the project. In such
a case, I am providing you with a fully functional shell, that can be used for 
further modifications and/or installations.

Further development of this project is NOT copyright protected but in case you have
questions, feel free to
